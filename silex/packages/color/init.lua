\begin{document}
The \autodoc:package{color} package allows you to temporarily change the color of the (virtual) ink that SILE uses to output text and rules.
The package provides a \autodoc:command{\color} command which takes one parameter, \autodoc:parameter{color=<color specification>}, and typesets its argument in that color.

The color specification is one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item{A RGB color in \code{#xxx} or \code{#xxxxxx} format, where \code{x} represents a hexadecimal digit, as often seen in HTML/CSS (\code{#000} is black, \code{#fff} is white, \code{#f00} is red, and so on);}
\item{A RGB color as a series of three numeric values between 0 and 255 (e.g. \code{0 0 139} is a dark blue) or as three percentages;}
\item{A CMYK color as a series of four numeric values between 0 and 255 or as four percentages;}
\item{A grayscale color as a numeric value between 0 and 255;}
\item{A (case-insensitive) named color, as one of the 148 keywords defined in the CSS Color Module Level 4. (Named colors resolve to RGB in the actual output.)}
\end{itemize}

So, for example, \color[color=red]{this text is typeset with \autodoc:command{\color[color=red]{â€¦}}}.

Here is a rule typeset with \autodoc:command{\color[color=#22dd33]}: \color[color=#22dd33]{\hrule[width=120pt,height=0.5pt]}
